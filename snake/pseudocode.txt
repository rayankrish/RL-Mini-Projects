while true:
    if no food:
        spawn random food on tile where there is no snake

    move head one step forward (in orientation) and update tail locations

    if head off screen or head on tail pos
        die

    if head on food, update score, add to tail, and remove food


arrow key listener:
    update orientation


steps:
    snake mechanics no food (have fixed tail length)


--------------------------
should we implement a cost for every time step for which the apple is not gotten?
how would an algorithm learn to avoid or go around itself??
how do we pick a time horizon n that gives the agent enough intermediate states?
